Simplify How, When, & Where You Do Business With BSC (BlackDiamond SC)Tokens. Never Worry About The Fees, Focus More On The Business.

What Are the Main Supply Chain Challenges?

The modern supply chain must evolve to meet new demands and supply chain challenges, and supply chain managers need to plan ahead to keep everything flowing smoothly. A combination of consumer expectations, more routes to market, international complexities and other factors creates significant challenges throughout the supply chain network.

The coronavirus crisis has revealed the fragility of the modern supply chain.
• Recent data shows the devastating economic impact as week-on-week trade in China, the US and Europe halved because of the crisis.
• Diverse sourcing and digitization will be the key to building stronger, smarter supply chains and ensuring a lasting recovery.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit global trade and investment at an unprecedented speed and scale. Multinational companies faced an initial supply shock, then a demand shock as more and more countries ordered people to stay at home. Governments, businesses and individual consumers suddenly struggled to procure basic products and materials, and were forced to confront the fragility of the modern supply chain. The urgent need to design smarter, stronger and more diverse supply chains has been one of the main lessons of this crisis.

Increased Costs Throughout the Supply Chain
Profit margins are under pressure as costs creep up throughout the supply chain network. These costs come from many areas, and a lack of visibility and accountability for reducing them can result in rising operational expenses.
Major contributors to increased costs include:
* 		Rising price of fuel to transport goods by road, sea or air
* 		Increasing commodity prices raising the cost of raw materials
* 		Higher labor costs from suppliers and manufacturers
* 		Complex international logistics leading to higher charges for storage, transfer and management of products

Supply Chain Complexity Due to Multiple Channels to Market
Consumers buy products across multiple channels, and as routes to market increase, the underlying supply chain must adapt. Supply chain managers need to develop variations on supply chain processes to address each of the channels:
* 		eCommerce websites selling directly to consumers require fast last-mile delivery and local logistics.
* 		Traditional retailers and wholesalers need large storage locations close to major metropolitan areas, combined with accurate inventory control to ensure product availability.
* 		Third-party marketplaces like Amazon require a deep understanding of fulfillment options and close compliance with their terms and conditions.
* 		Drop shipping retail requires fast international services so that consumers receive goods quickly.
Supply chain managers must manage multiple supply chains, third parties and other organizations to ensure a good end customer experience, regardless of how they order and receive products.

Risk in the Supply Chain Creates Pressure
International complexity, environmental changes, economic pressures and trade disputes all put pressure on the supply chain. This pressure can easily turn into risks and issues that snowball throughout the network, causing significant problems:
* 		Suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, clients and customers are spread across multiple countries, time zones and continents, requiring careful coordination and management.
* 		Adding more steps to the supply chain creates exponential complexity for upstream and downstream partners.
* 		Siloed data and a lack of visibility increases the difficulty of reporting, business intelligence and good decision-making.
* 		Regulations, compliance and quality management demands strong agreements, contracts and controls with supply chain organizations.
Supply chain managers must develop contingencies and mitigating action plans to prioritize and eliminate risks and manage issues when they occur.

Risk in the Supply Chain Creates Pressure

The Solution:

What Is Tokenization?
Tokenization is the act of representing something of value with a token, on a blockchain network. This can be anything from money to real estate, the token acts as an asset representing that item, and is operated on a particular blockchain network through smart contracts. Tokenization has infiltrated several unsuspecting industries in recent years and is giving all the indications to prove it is here to stay.

Tokenization in the Supply Chain Industry
In order to incorporate tokenization, the supply chain management system will need to be operated on the same blockchain network. The movement and storage of raw goods to end products will be traced by the use of a token, essentially creating digital representations of the goods that can be traced by the supply chain manager. Two problems the current centralized systems are facing are isolated data storage and a lack of trust between the multiple entities. With a blockchain network, all data is stored in real time and is available for any involved parties to see. The issue of trust is solved as blocks recording the information in the blockchain cannot be tampered with.

New Supply Chain Tokenization 
BlackDiamond SC, a company fairly new in this movement, is currently implementing these processes into their supply chain network. The company is spanning across several industries. These industries range from events, minerals, renewable energy to wine and spirits exc. BSC is built upon the Ethereum blockchain and can facilitate a number of transactions that pan across the various industries requirements; paying a utility bill, leasing equipment, decentralized e-commerce and much more etc. This shared infrastructure allows for vertical and horizontal integration of the portfolio companies, as well as allowing quick attainment of economies of scale.
In conclusion, the integration of blockchain tokenization is slowly but surely infiltrating into industries that have been around for decades, if not centuries. This is indeed a leap forward in terms of technology, but also in establishing trust and easier and more transparent supply chain management. We are already seeing tokenization revolutionize the supply chain industry, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes the norm.

In the context of trade financing, tokenization has the potential to solve many problems; among these the creation of ‘smart’ contracts, shipment tracking, and buyer confirmations. But one of the biggest problems it could solve is in freeing-up liquidity when it comes to non-liquid assets, like unpaid invoices.
Late, or unpaid invoices are a huge pain point for businesses both large and small, but are especially painful for small to medium sized businesses (SMBs). The numbers back this up too, with one in five SMBs failing to survive past their first five years, citing unpaid invoices as the number one reason for failure[1]. If tokenization is all it’s cracked up to be, it could be a game-changer for these struggling SMBs. 

The Technology
The first two characteristics we will look at are the core results of using blockchain. They are tools that allow us to create a system that can keep track of the history or provenance of the materials we are transacting and ensure that record is trustworthy:
* 		Blockchain can tokenize minerals and metals, assets, along with key due diligence data submitted by all participating supply chain actors. These tokens are digital assets that are highly tamper-resistant.
* 		Blockchain maintains an unchangeable record of transactions for these tokens. This gives us the ability to create an immutable chain of custody and confidence in the data in our system.
The Incentives
The next two characteristics provide incentives for every supply chain actor to use our well-designed technology tools. They are how we can turn our system from a novelty for companies who know each other well, into a global infrastructure that can address some of the deepest problems the mineral supply chain, energy supply chain and the manufacturers supply chain faces:
* 		Blockchain can create self-governed incentive systems, to make it beneficial for supply chain actors to participate in the system.
* 		Blockchain allows parties who do not trust each other to transact without a trusted third party, eliminating the need to trust a single company with supply chain data.
The success of our mineral blockchain tracking system depends completely on designing the technology tools properly, as well as the incentives.

Tokens are digital assets that are created according to rules agreed upon by everyone using the blockchain. They cannot be produced in any other way, and cannot be duplicated or forged. This property means we can limit the number of tokens available, and this rarity means they can represent real-world assets such as minerals or metals.


Imagine we start a company that wants to produce responsible gold for investment purposes. They purchase all their gold from one large scale refiner that purchases all their supply from one large scale mine. All of the production practices are responsible and are regularly audited so our company can be confident that the gold is responsible.
We purchase this gold in the form of 1oz bars and put the bars into a vault. For each bar in the vault we create a fungible, digital token on a blockchain which is then sold on the open market. This gold token would contain a link back to a website that shows how responsible the gold is. At any point, the owner of a gold token could redeem the token with our company to receive a gold bar from our vault.
Positive Outcomes of this Approach
* 		Fungible tokens are easy to manage because we do not need a physical identifier linking the token to the metal. We know all the metal is in a vault, and it all comes from one source, so it doesn’t matter which bar is which.
* 		Investors can move into and out of gold positions fluidly with minimal transaction fees.
* 		Implementation is straightforward — there are few real-world company processes that would have to be changed, and only one company (ours) needs to know how to use the blockchain. Our company can decide to implement such a system unilaterally without the buy-in from every member of the supply chain.
Limitations of Fungible Tokens
* 		The tokens are only able to be fungible because we control all the aspects of responsibility of the supply chain and keep the gold from these processes separate from the rest of the market. It works well because we have one vault storing all our gold coming from only known sources and audited supply chains. If multiple companies each create their own vault and their own fungible token, these tokens could not be mixed without losing the information about which vaults held our gold. This makes such a system difficult to scale
* 		Gold token buyers have to trust us when we say that the gold is responsible. Our company is providing data on a webpage showing that the gold in our vault is responsibly sourced, but there’s nothing in the system itself that tracks the gold from the extraction point up the supply chain. This might be good enough when we have one source and a lot of data on that source, however to scale, we will likely need stronger supply chain traceability.
* 		Fungible tokens may represent responsibly sourced metals, but they are still very valuable digital assets that can be transferred at will between wallets without needing a middleman. Ironically, this means our responsible gold tokens could be used to launder money, and we would need to take measures to prevent this.
Example 2 — Adding a layer of complexity to fungible tokens representing gold
Our previous example had very limited use of blockchain. We were able to create a digital representation of the gold in a vault, but the gold didn’t move. We can think of this as being able to track the amount of gold in the vault, which is one actor at one level of the gold supply chain.
Can we just add actors each with their own fungible tokens to get better depth to our supply chain tracking?
Imagine a gold mine processing ore onsite into “doré” bars, which is partially refined gold that still has silver mixed in. For each bar, they create a doré token, which is fungible. Just like the example above, the tokens are not traceable to a particular bar, but rather the amount of tokens are limited by the quantity of doré produced on site.
When a shipment of bars is sold to a refiner, the mine would send an equivalent amount of doré tokens to the refiner. The refiner would then be able to destroy the doré tokens in order to create gold bar tokens.
The gold bar tokens would be sent to our company along with the gold bars which are then put in the vault. With the gold bars in the vault, our fungible gold bar tokens can then be sold on the open market as in the example above.
This system will allow us to track volumes of doré produced at the mine and volumes of doré that are converted to gold bars, however it does not allow us to track specific bars or shipments.
Positive Outcomes of this Approach
* 		This method gives us data about how much material is coming from each source, and this data is stored on the blockchain.
* 		The tokens at the end of the process are still fungible and that makes them easy to trade.
Limitations of this Approach
* 		Because we are tracking materials along a supply chain, we need all companies along the supply chain to participate, making it more challenging to implement a project. These companies will likely need to adjust their internal processes in order to keep track of these blockchain-tracked shipments, meaning more work and cost.
* 		Each new supply chain actor who creates a fungible token is an actor we need to trust. This means there are multiple points where the system could be vulnerable to human error or malicious intent because we now have to record more than just transactions, we have to record transformations (when the metal is refined and processed).
* 		Because the tokens are still fungible, we cannot link them to specific shipments of metal. This limits our ability to record the transformations because we don’t have data on the specific shipments.
This method essentially introduces a level of non-fungibility into our system. Although both the doré and the gold bar tokens are fungible, they cannot be mixed with each other.
By adding layers of non-fungibility we get greater visibility into what’s going on in our supply chain, at the cost of it being more complex to implement.

Non-Fungible tokens
Now that we have designed a basic token-based tracking system, we want to have an even greater level of detailed information which metals come from where. Perhaps traceability is more important to us than trading liquidity. For this, we can use non-fungible tokens to represent metal in our supply chain.
Non-fungible tokens can be created to represent specific shipments of metal ores or ingots, so they are not interchangeable with another token, and effectively act as a digital twin that can be used to demonstrate who owns it. Each token can contain a link to data that demonstrates the responsibility of the shipment that it is linked to.
Example 3 — Non-Fungible Token Representing Gold
We can use a non-fungible token in our gold scenario which will act a bit like passing a baton from person to person in a relay race. When it gets to the end, it will have the fingerprints of everyone who held it, giving the owner a detailed history of the item.
To illustrate, let’s go back to our gold mine again. Our responsible gold mine wants to sell responsibly sourced gold to their customers.
They extract gold, melt it into doré bars that are weighed, and a non-fungible “doré” token is created to represent each bar. This time, the doré token contains a unique ID, which is put on a tag and attached to the doré bar, as well as a link to a database of due diligence data about the company that produced it. As the doré bars are passed from owner to owner, the associated non-fungible tokens are also passed along to each new owner.
When each doré bar reaches the refiner, like before, it is processed into 1 oz gold bars. Unlike before we will not destroy the doré tokens, but rather freeze them so they can no longer be traded. When the new gold tokens are created they will link to the old doré tokens so we have a record of where they came from. When we put our gold bars in a vault, each will have a unique ID and customers can sell them on the open market, or redeem them for their specific gold bar.
Improvements Over Fungible Tokens
* 		Non-fungible tokens allow us to represent individual units of material (the doré bars and the kilo bars). Having this extra granularity of data means we are not limited to a single mineral source or vault.
* 		Because the individual shipments are represented, we can also record who held them and where they were produced. This allows us to track minerals from the point of production, all the way down the supply chain.
* 		The tokens are linked to specific bars or shipments, making them more difficult to use for money laundering.
Some New Challenges
* 		For the tokens to track the metal, we need to link the metal to the non-fungible tokens. Tagging presents a challenge whenever the material is processed or changes form.
* 		We still need to ensure that good data is provided to the blockchain. Our non-fungible tokens are only as useful as the data they are based on.
And of course, we lose all the benefits of fungible tokens. If we are tracking individual gold bars with a unique ID, we need to check these IDs whenever we trade them and make sure we have the right ones if we sell the physical bars. There is no getting around this. The point of tracking individual bars is to de-commoditize the gold.
If we want to say that a gold bar that comes from a responsible source is different than one that funded human rights abuse, this is the trade-off.

In short, the easiest way to tokenize such assets as oil and gas is to sell the share right by using smart contracts. Yet, creating the smart contract, notwithstanding the complexity level is the easiest part of asset tokenization. 
More important is to keep with the transparency. Token holders and investors should know what they are paying for, so here is basically a simple yet very effective solution.
Constant Changes
We should understand that such assets as oil and gas are involved in constant circulation and are difficult to be calculated due to sustained movement. Therefore the most appropriate time to calculate its amount is straight during the producing stage. Each producing “station” has its own system, where it records the number of resources produced. 
And so, it’s possible not to create everything from scratch but to embed Blockchain directly to the existing system. Accordingly, each time our “station” produced a certain amount, it will be recorded in the blockchain network. Afterward, the system will give a signal to the Smart Contract to mint new tokens. The tokens will represent the equity rights or/and shares of the Management Company.
The key benefits of such an approach:

* The audit and quality control are easier to be held;
* The data will be un-erasable, and easily reached;
* Private Blockchain allows dividing data access/management to different roles, with personal validation keys;
* Reduces time management for collecting data;
* Provides a transparent management system;
* Increases the oil and gas trading market;
* Confirms the availability of resources, as well as shows the real worth of the tokens.
If you will succeed in tokenizing assets like oil and gas, the whole world will undergo dramatic changes. The understanding that assets may not be bound to the US dollar anymore will open more and more opportunities. Having a unique way to sell, coordinate and hold these assets will simplify the process of their trade. The world is waiting for great changes, and you could be the one to start them!
