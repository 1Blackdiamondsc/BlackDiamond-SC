 * @title ERC20HoldableToken
 * @notice A hold is like an approve where held tokens can not be spent by the token holder until after an hold expiration period.
    The hold can be executed by a notary, which can be the recipient of the tokens, a third party or a smart contract.
    The notary can execute the hold before or after the expiration period.
    Additionally, a hash lock at be applied which requires the notary of the hold to present the hash preimage to execute the hold.
    Held tokens can be released by the notary at any time or by the token holder after the expiration period.
    A recipient does not have to get set at the time of the hold, which means it will have to be specified when the hold is executed.
